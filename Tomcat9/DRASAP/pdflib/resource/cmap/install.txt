CMap configuration
==================

[2006-08-08 Package created for PDFlib 7.0.0]

In order to create Chinese, Japanese, or Korean (CJK) text output with
one of the predefined CMaps PDFlib requires the corresponding CMap files
for processing the incoming text and mapping CJK encodings to Unicode.

The CMap files are available in a separate package. They should be
installed as follows:

- On Windows the CMap files will be found automatically if you place them
  in the resource/cmap directory within the PDFlib installation directory.

- On other systems you can place the CMap files at any convenient directory,
  and must manually configure the CMap files by setting the searchpath at
  runtime:

    PDF_set_parameter(p, "searchpath", "/path/to/resource/cmap");
    oPDF.set_parameter("searchpath", "/path/to/resource/cmap")


Refer to the PDFlib documentation for more information on CJK text handling.
